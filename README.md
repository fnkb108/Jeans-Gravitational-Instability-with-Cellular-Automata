# Jeans-Gravitational-Instability-with-Cellular-Automata

## Version 1
In this simple model, I use following rule:

We **compare the values of mass** in defined cell and its neighboring cells(for example: a[i,j] and a[i+1,j]) . If value of first cell's mass is higher, we **transfer 20% of neighboring cell's mass** to this cell.
